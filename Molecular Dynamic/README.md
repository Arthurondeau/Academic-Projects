# Molecular Dynamics - Osmosic pressure 


## Content of the project
The objective is to simulate the interaction between two populations of particles confined in a space containing a permeable wall in order to mesure 
the osmotic pressure.

### How to run the simulation
Launch the simulation simply by running run_osmo.py.The file is dedicated for the user, the user can change several parameters without having to change the simulation. 
The file simul_osmos.py is dedicated to the calculation of physical interactions between particles and the update of the particles position. The model considered here is that of hard disks.
The file animate_simul.py is dedicated to the visualisation of the particles thanks to EllipseCollection.
