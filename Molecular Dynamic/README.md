# Molecular Dynamics - Osmosic pressure (ongoing)

# Disclaimer 
This project is ongoing, the code is not finished.
## Content of the project
The objective is to simulate the interaction between two populations of particles confined in a space containing a permeable wall in order to mesure 
the osmotic pressure.

### API specification
The file run_osmo.py is dedicated for the user. The user can change several parameters without having to change the simulation. 
The file simul_osmos.py is dedicated to the calculation of physical interactions between particles. The model considered here is that of hard disks.
The file animate_simul.py is dedicated to the visualisation of the particles thanks to EllipseCollection.
